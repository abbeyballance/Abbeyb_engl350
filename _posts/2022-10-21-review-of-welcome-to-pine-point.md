# Project Overview
The Digital Humanities project [Welcome to Pine Point](https://pinepoint.nfb.ca/?_gl=1*h7j8i9*_ga*NTQyNjU4ODgzLjE2NjQ5Mjc0ODM.*_ga_EP6WV87GNV*MTY2NjEzODI0Mi40LjAuMTY2NjEzODI0Mi4wLjAuMA..) was created by Michael Simons and Paul Shoebridge, the duo formally known as [The Goggles](http://www.thegoggles.org/). It is a simple, click-through interactive documentary about the town formerly known as [Pine Point, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Point,_Northwest_Territories). It chronicles the town’s community and importance, its slow dissolution and eventual removal from all maps in the year 1989, and analyzes the effects of its nihility. The content is arranged in scrapbook form, in various interactive mediums including videos, photos, voice-overs, music, drawing, text, and town artifacts.

One of the creators, Michael Simons, visited Pine Point for a hockey game when he was nine years old, his first solo trip away from home. Years later, he and his partner, Paul Shoebridge, were working on writing a book about the decline of the popularity of photo albums. As they were researching this phenomenon, they stumbled across a website called Pine Point Revisited. This site, created by a past member of the Pine Point community, Richard Cloutier, was a written and visual account of the town’s compiled history- which has since been disabled and made inaccessible.

In a bout of nostalgia, Simons searched online for the town, attempting to revisit this fleeting, seemingly insignificant memory. To his dismay, he found that the town no longer existed, consumed by nature. Simons and Shoebridge were intrigued, so they decided to create a project analyzing and revealing what happens when an entire town just disappears off the map. 

## Creators and Contributors 
Canadian natives Paul Shoebridge and Michael Simons, also known as [The Goggles Media Group](http://www.thegoggles.org/), created, wrote, and directed the entirety of the Welcome to Pine Point project. The Goggles have committed their professional lives to telling stories in compelling and innovative ways. They have successfully completed a number of interesting projects, with six showcased on their website. They have received numerous international awards, had their work featured at festivals and competitions, [co-authored a book](https://quillandquire.com/review/i-live-here/), and are currently developing a TV comedy. 

The Goggles were aided in their efforts by two teams of professionals. The original project website was created by a team of 11 professionals, with Rob McLaughlin serving as the executive producer. The [HTML5](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5847/a-marketer-s-guide-to-html5.aspx) Re-design of the project was created by a team of 11 different professionals, with Rob McLaughlin as the only member from the original team. You can view the names of the contributors [here](https://www.nfb.ca/interactive/welcome_to_pine_point/). 

## Intended Audience
The intended audience for this project was not specified by the creators. In my opinion there are three possible intended audiences including former members of the town, Canadians, and the general public, specifically those interested in history. 

First, as the entire project is a make-shift tribute to the town, former members of the town, PinePointers, would be intrigued, enthused, and perhaps feel honored by the project. Through the documentary, they are able to relive a part of their past life and, for some, reconnect with their roots. 

Next, as Pine Point was a former town in Canada, it can be assumed all Canadians would be interested in learning about it and its history, as a large majority of the population is most likely not aware of its existence. The project would offer Canadian citizens an in-depth look at a small, but meaningful, facet of their country. 

Finally, the general public, specifically those interested in history, could be an intended audience for the project. As most people are unaware of Pine Point’s existence, the project essentially raises awareness of it and draws attention to it. I think those interested in history would be more inclined to view the documentary, simply because it is historically based and archives a piece of the past. Additionally, history buffs are intrigued to know everything they can about the past, especially those parts/events/aspects that no longer exist. 

# Project Review 
## Humanistic Claims and Evidence 
### History

Welcome to Pine Point can be tied back to two specific fields in the humanities, both history and visual arts. 

According to [K12 Academics](https://www.k12academics.com/College%20Degrees/Humanities/humanities-academic-fields), an esteemed education resource, the field of history in the digital humanities, “refers to the study and interpretation of the record of humans, societies, institutions, and any topic that has changed over time.” 

This project directly relates to the field of history, as it overviews and analyzes the former town of Pine Point, a small part of Canada’s history. The project does an excellent job demonstrating how it relates to this field. It advances the field by drawing attention to a piece of history that has been overlooked. 

The creators compiled a variety of data including history about the town, its economy, and the community, among other things. This data is easy to understand; however, it was not organized or input in an accessible form. For example, from what I can tell, there is no alternative text for the images or videos. 

### Visual Arts
According to the [Minnesota Libraries Publishing Project](https://mlpp.pressbooks.pub/introductiontohumanitiesv2/chapter/visual-arts/#:~:text=The%20visual%20arts%20are%20art,design%2C%20crafts%2C%20and%20architecture.), the field of Visual Arts includes, “painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, ceramics, photography, video, filmmaking, design, crafts, and architecture.” 

Upon review, it is identifiable that Welcome to Pine Point utilizes drawing, photography, videography, filmmaking, and design. The project does an outstanding job demonstrating how it engages with this discipline, as the entirety of the project was created utilizing these areas of the visual arts. 

This project advances knowledge about visual arts simply by existing. The creators utilized the various forms of visual arts to display the content and, in turn, engaged the audience in new ways. To my knowledge, there are no projects similar to this one, so it serves as a model for what the visual arts can be and accomplish. 

## Technology Used 
There is no in-depth description of the technology used on the Welcome to Pine Point project. It is clear that they used photography, videography, [skeuomorphic design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/skeuomorphism), and a drawing/sketching program. The creators utilized these forms of technology to advance its overall goal of analyzing what happens when a town falls off the map. 

Without the utilization of this technology, the project would not have been as successful in illustrating the essence of Pine Point. Traditional scholarship, such as a scholarly paper, would not have nearly the same impact on the audience and this fact can be attributed to the use of technology, specifically photography and videography. 

The technology utilized that I identified was easy to navigate, as it was all fairly common, However, I am sure the nitty gritty, behind-the-scenes was exceedingly difficult. I would have appreciated at least a brief overview of the technologies used to create the project, as that would offer a deeper understanding of the project’s creation process. 

## Interesting Facets
I cannot emphasize enough how interesting and overwhelmingly outstanding this project is. I have never come across anything like it and am mesmerized by everything it has to offer. Additionally, I have never come across anything quite so captivating about something so seemingly unimportant. 

The inclusion of photos, videos, and artifacts of and from Pine Point significantly influenced the impact of the project. These aspects gave viewers a glimpse into the Pine Point community, what life was like there, and made it possible to actually connect and empathize with and for the town. 

Reading about the lives of four former community members and their “then and now” stories, made the town feel real. Looking at pictures of the landscape and group photos did not feel intimate or made me feel connected to the town in any way. It was just like watching a fictitious movie. However, reading in-depthly about these people’s lives and hearing their voices, affirmed that the town did, in fact, exist and these people were, in fact, impacted by its disappearance. It is a part of them, it shaped them, it made them who they are today.

## Problematic Issues
I did notice a few small flaws and errors within the project. First, on one of the screens in the “Town” section, you cannot read the text while the images are free floating around the screen. 

Next, in the “PinePointers” section, there is a voiceover of the people talking, but there is no image/video of this. It was difficult to follow/understand what they were saying without having something to look at, like their lips, while they were talking. 

In the “Ends and Odds” section, the text appears first and then the badges fill the screen and cover up the text. Viewers are able to toggle the badges and move them around the screen. However, there are no directions for this, so without first attempting, viewers could just stare at the screen waiting for the badges to move. 


![photo of ends and odds page with stamps](https://abbeyballance.github.io/Abbeyb_engl350/images/stamps.png)
In the “Shelf Life” section, there are photos/graphics to click through and review while the audio is playing. There is no description of these photos, so viewers don’t exactly know what they are looking at. 

# Relation to my Project
I am working with [Claire Harvey](https://twitter.com/CB_HarveyDH) to create a grant proposal for an interactive documentary describing her grandmother’s battle with Alzheimer’s and explaining what the disease is, as a whole, and the effects of it. Welcome to Pine Point is close to an exact model of what we want our project to look like/be. 

I’m exceedingly inspired by this project, because, as I previously discussed, it sheds light on a topic that would have most likely been overlooked. It was not a quick, one and done process either. The creators spent valuable time, energy, and money creating this production, all for a forgotten town. They _made_ people care about Pine Point. 

Similarly to Pine Point, Claire’s grandmother’s story has never been told and probably would not have the opportunity to be shared if it weren’t for our project. I admire the subjects/things that fall within the cracks and do not get wide attention from the general public. Although these things, like Pine Point and Claire’s grandmother’s story, are not overwhelmingly popular, they still matter, deeply. These projects are testaments to the fact that every single thing within the universe has purpose and deserves to be recognized and appreciated. 

Just like Pine Point, our project will illustrate just how much the digital humanities can do by displaying information in new, compelling, and interactable ways. Additionally, we will be communicating information about the disease, raising awareness of its severity, and teaching viewers what they can do to help those who have fallen victim to it.
