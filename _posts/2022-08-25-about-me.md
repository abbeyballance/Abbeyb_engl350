Hi! 

My name is Abbey Ballance and my pronouns are she/her. 

#Hometown

I hail from [Franklin](https://www.visitfranklinsouthamptonva.com/), a _teeny tiny_ little city in southeastern Virginia. It is a heavily rural area that emphasizes community ties, agriculture, religion, and republican politics. Yes, you read that right. 

Growing up in a small town was less of an “adventure” and more of a tactful game of _avoidance_. Don’t get me wrong, I liked knowing _all_ of the people who lived near me and, in the least narcissistic way I can say this, I admired being known. But, irregardless, there is something to be said about how uncomfortable this environment actually is. 

As I got older and became more aware of those around me, I began to fear “going into town” because I knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that I would undoubtedly run into someone I was acquainted with. I would find myself **bobbing and weaving** down aisles as I attempted to avoid eye contact with someone I knew. 

Now, this may not seem uncomfortable to you looking, or reading, from the outside in. But, when you find yourself having an “off” day, you just don’t want to be forced to talk to your cousin’s friend’s YMCA soccer coach, in the clinique section at the local Belk.

I will always be grateful for my hometown. I don’t owe gratitude to it for the cliche, “how it shaped me” reasoning, but rather how it did not. Growing up in Franklin made me appreciate, all too much, that the world is **BIG**, and I mean that in every sense and essence of the word. 

#The Future

>I find myself mesmerized, and sometimes paralyzed, by the thought of how many opportunities there are on this **big** green and blue planet. 

In the future, post graduation, if life and luck both fall in my favor, I hope to be an international travel blogger. How I plan to do so you may ask? I have no idea and, unfortunately, no plan. But, alas, I am more than determined to see and experience the world, in some way or another. 

#College

I entered Christopher Newport University, CNU, in the fall of 2020. I am currently set to graduate one year early, and walk across the stage _this_ spring. 

From the very beginning, I have been passionately attune as a **Communication major with a writing minor**. My choice of a minor has swayed here and there, across departments; from digital humanities, to photography, to spanish (that was a hard place), and, finally, to my favorite articulately wordy place, writing. 

Over the past two years, I have dabbled in a few extracurriculars on and off campus. 

*I am an active member of a social sorority, [Alpha Delta Pi](https://www.alphadeltapi.org/), and serve as this term’s Wellness Specialist. 

*Throughout my sophomore year, I had the opportunity to serve as a student intern in the [Office of Communications at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility](https://www.jlab.org/about/comms). 

*I was a member of the [Campus Activities Board](https://thecompass.cnu.edu/organization/cab) and served on the Spirit and Traditions Committee. 

*This year I am an intern in [CNU’s Office of Communication and Public Relations](https://cnu.edu/ocpr/), OCPR. We are currently working on starting a CNU Podcast! 

#My Walk with Digital Humanities

If I’m being honest, I had no idea what the Digital Humanities, DH, actually was before the first week of class. I knew it was online writing, in some sense of the phrase, but nothing more than that. 

Although this course only stands to fill an elective requirement for my minor, I have found great interest in the very idea of DH. Through our initial reading assignments, I’ve almost become inspired how DH stands to be, [in Anne Burdick’s words](https://jeffreyschnapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/D_H_ShortGuide.pdf), “process- rather than product-based.”  

I love that DH allows scholars, and average people alike, to collaborate on projects and find knowledge and goodness in every step along the way.
