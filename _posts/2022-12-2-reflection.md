# Reflection



I initially enrolled in this course simply because I needed another elective to support my writing minor. I genuinely had no idea what “Digital Humanities” was or what we would be learning in the class. After almost completing the course, I can confidently say that my notion of Digital Humanities, DH, was undoubtedly false at the beginning of the semester. 

I was under the impression that DH was any digital work involving a field of the humanities (i.e. online history articles). In hindsight, I think that was a fair assumption based on the name and my limited knowledge; however, I now know that DH is much, much more than that. 

After reading numerous articles and studies on DH and writing my own grant proposal, DH has a new meaning to me. DH is the intersection of technology and humanities in interactive, innovative forms that are accessible to the mass majority of the population, even to demographics and areas that normally would not have access. 

I have a much better understanding of the field now and even admire it. My favorite thing about DH is that it makes knowledge and learning opportunities more accessible to everyone. One way it does this is by being almost completely accessible online. This way, anyone with access to the internet can view a DH project and take in that knowledge. Additionally, it puts knowledge in forms that are understandable to those who are not professionals or have limited knowledge of a chosen topic. For example, a biology major can view a historical DH project online and learn ample knowledge about something they might have never had access to before. 

I generally enjoyed completing the readings. They were not too difficult to understand and I normally found them to be genuinely interesting. My favorite one was the excerpt from Anne Lamott’s “Shitty First Drafts.” I made so many highlights and notes in this chapter that I went so far as to order the book and read it myself. I haven’t gotten all the way through it yet, but I am thoroughly enjoying the read! I also thought the text-scanning article was exceedingly interesting, as well as beneficial as I wrote my first research blog. 

I did not particularly enjoy reading the research studies/papers as much. They were quite lengthy with technical jargon that I did not understand completely. I often found myself getting lost in all of the many, many paragraphs of these readings. For example, I could barely comprehend “Research through design and digital humanities in practice: What, how and who in an archive research project.” Looking back over it now, I still do not understand what the authors were talking about in this article. 

I also have to admit that I have not enjoyed the process of writing the grant proposal. It has kind of just felt like a waste of time since we are not actually creating our proposed DH projects. It has been interesting to learn what goes into a grant proposal and the complexities of that process. However, this assignment has not greatly aided me in better understanding DH as a whole. I would have much rather had a final project where we actually created a small-scale DH project or something along those lines. 

I did thoroughly enjoy being exposed to various different DH projects. For example, “Welcome to Pine Point” and “Mapping the Green Book” were two of my favorite projects. I learned so much from these projects and if not for this class and DH, I probably would have never had the opportunity to gain that knowledge.
